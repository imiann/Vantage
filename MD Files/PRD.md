## Vision

A centralized management tool for freelance video editors to track leads, manage projects, and monitor financial performance — lightweight, private, and optimized for a single operator workflow.

## Features

- **Lead CRM:** Track inquiries with a status lifecycle (INBOUND, OUTBOUND, FOLLOW_UP, CONVERTED, LOST).
- **Project Tracker:** Manage active video projects, clients, and revenue.
- **Automated Link Validation:** Background workers validation external links (Google Drive, Frame.io) as they are added, reporting BROKEN status if inaccessible.
- **Financial Monitor:** Dashboard for gross revenue and tax set-aside recommendations (Quebec/Canada).
- **Observability:** Performance tracking for background tasks and system health.

## Out of Scope (v1)

- **Video Hosting:** Internal storage not supported; external links only.
- **Social Media:** No direct posting.
- **Public Marketplace:** Single-user private tool.
