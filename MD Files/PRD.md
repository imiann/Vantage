## Vision

A centralized management tool for freelance video editors to track leads, manage projects, and monitor financial performance — lightweight, private, and optimized for a single operator workflow.

## What the App Is

- **Lead CRM:** Track inbound and outbound inquiries with a status lifecycle (INBOUND, OUTBOUND, FOLLOW_UP, CONVERTED, LOST). Store contact info, source, tags, and follow-up dates.
- **Project Tracker:** Manage active video projects, clients, revision links, delivery status, and revenue per project.
- **Financial Monitor:** Dashboard to calculate gross revenue and provide tax set-aside recommendations for Quebec/Canada (configurable percentage).
- **Automated Documentation:** Self-documenting REST API (OpenAPI/Swagger).

## What the App Is Not (v1)

- **Video Hosting:** Stores links to external storage (Google Drive, Frame.io); does not host files.
- **Social Media Manager:** Will not post to social platforms directly.
- **Public Marketplace:** Single-user private tool — no client-facing logins in v1.
